# Binary-Classification-with-a-Bank-Dataset
machine learning model to predict whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit based on their profile and interactions

# 🏦 Binary Classification with Bank Marketing Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Binary Classification model** to predict whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit, based on their profile and interactions from a Bank Marketing dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes demographic and marketing-related features such as:
- Age, Job, Marital Status, Education
- Contact type, Campaign outcomes, Duration, etc.  
- **Target variable:** `y` → (yes/no for subscription)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Loading & Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling categorical variables (Label Encoding)
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
3. Train-Test Split
4. Model Building
   - Logistic Regression
   - Other classifiers (if tested)
5. Model Evaluation
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 📈 Results
- Achieved good classification performance on the test dataset.
- Insights: Certain features (like duration, job, and contact type) significantly affect the outcome.

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)
